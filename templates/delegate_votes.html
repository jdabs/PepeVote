    Keeping up with all the newest pieces of art can be time consuming. Leave it to the experts and delegate your votes to those who you know have good pepe taste.

    If you are uncomfortable using your main token storage address to sign messages, you can delegate signing to an empty secondary address.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Please note:</b> Delegated votes are currently non-transferrable. Your delegate cannot delegate votes on your behalf.
